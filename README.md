## About The Project

For a few years, we can observe a generalization of the platforms of streaming in the homes. For example, Netflix has gone from 21 to 221 million subscribers in the space of 10 years. We can also note an increase in the number of platforms in recent years.
With these strong increases, it seems interesting to us to question the content offered by these different platforms, in order to compare them on their catalog, and perhaps also to allow us to study the types of study the types of films/series that attract certain age groups.
To do so, we have retrieved datasets from the three main companies in the streaming market, namely Netflix streaming market, namely Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+.

In addition, we thought it would be interesting to study the movie industry from a broader angle, which is why we also selected another set of that is why we also selected another dataset, with more numerical information on different aspects of information on different aspects of film production.
The datasets are available in this archive: datasets.rar
